# MD 2 HTML PARSER #
Made by Dmitri Qiu.
## Description
MD2HTML parser is a easy to use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "About Markdown") parser/renderer written in Python. It's extendable, fast, and user friendly.
## Usage
Import MD2HTML to your project by `import MD2HTML as m2h` and then write the following code:
```python
with open("Your md doc.md") as doc:
    renderer = m2h.Renderer()
    result = renderer.render(doc, False, True, "Your/Image/Folder") # The first boolean is for not displaying line count
                                                                    # The second is for return as file object
    result.close()
```
Then, you will see a file named `"Your md doc.html"` show up in your project folder.
Congrats! You rendered a MD file to html using M2H for the first time!
